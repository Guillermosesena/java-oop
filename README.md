## Introduction




## This&nbsp;repository
The purpose of these projects is just to apply the concepts reviewed in the OOP Java course:

- Create classes 
- Constructor Method 
- Constants 
- Overload functions 
- Encapsulation 
- Getters and setters 
- Static nested classes 
- Enumerations 
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism 
- Interfaces 
- Collections 
- Abstract classes

In addition to the exemplification of the previous concepts, the project contains a system for scheduling medical appointments. In which doctors must register the hours in which they can attend patients, while patients can schedule available appointments. The interface for this system is the IDE console.

## Dependencies
