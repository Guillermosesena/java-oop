## Introduction
Java is one of the most popular programming languages, which is based on object-oriented programming.

#### Abstraction
Abstraction consists of the interpretation and analysis of some scenario, so that it can be represented in programming as objects.

#### Class
It is a model in which attributes and methods are defined. Attributes are all those elements that define an object, while methods are all the actions or behaviors that an object can have. Classes are like templates used to create objects.

#### Instance
It is the initialization of an object, in which memory space is reserved for that object.

#### Constructor method
This the method is executed when an object is instantiated, it initialize the attributes of the object.

#### Modularity
The property allows an application to be divided into small parts, which is helped by the design of classes.

#### Encapsulation
The property that ensures that the information of an object is restricted to the outside, this is done by assigning a different type of access to the attributes of a class.

#### Inheritance
It is the property that allows to generate classes from an existing one, with this, the attributes and methods are reused by the new classes.

#### Polymorphism
The property that allows different behaviors associated with each object. This is used by classes that inherit from another, it is possible to modify the implementation of some of the inherited methods.


## This&nbsp;repository
The purpose of these projects is just to apply the concepts reviewed in the OOP Java course:

- Create classes 
- Constructor Method 
- Constants 
- Overload functions 
- Encapsulation 
- Getters and setters 
- Static nested classes 
- Enumerations 
- Inheritance 
- Polymorphism 
- Interfaces 
- Collections 
- Abstract classes

In addition to the exemplification of the previous concepts, the project contains a system for scheduling medical appointments. In which doctors must register the hours in which they can attend patients, while patients can schedule available appointments. The interface for this system is the IDE console.

## Dependencies
- Install JDK 11 or later
- Install Intellj or another IDE thats supports JDK 11

## Run&nbsp;Code
You can run these projects using IntelliJ or another IDE.
